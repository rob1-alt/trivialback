This project aims to be a social project. In the future we hope to raise awareness of ecological issues as much as possible. So we created a fullstack web app called Trivial that helps you take charge of your environment

-``trivialb-mariadb`` mariadb containter for the main db

- to start the environment go to your terminal and write the following commands :</br>

this command builds my image.</br>
`docker exec -it trivialb-node sh`</br>
executing the shell container of trivialb.</br>
`nodemon index.js`</br>

### Git flow


   - `main` : the main branch of the project

I used these two branches to ensure stable operation before each commit in the main branch
